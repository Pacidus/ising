# ising
More proper Ising model simulation

## lattice
It's the main place of the ising model, we have to initialize it with a tuple of the shape of the lattice wich can be any dimension or size.
The lattice can be initialized with a randomized state (you can choose the ratio of up state) or all in 1 or -1 state.

## metropolis
Implementation of the Metropolis algorithm.
